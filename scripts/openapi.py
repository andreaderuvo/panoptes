"""Write the API description out to `docs/openapi.json`.

Generated from the routes themselves, so a copy published anywhere cannot claim something
the board does not do — as long as it is regenerated. `tests/test_openapi.py` fails when it
drifts, which is what makes that "as long as" true.

Argus has carried one of these for a while and this board did not, which was an oversight
rather than a decision: four endpoints were added in a day and nothing outside the code said
so.

    python3 scripts/openapi.py          # rewrite it
    python3 scripts/openapi.py --check  # say whether it is current, change nothing
