"""Every flag says what it is for.

`--help` is the documentation people actually read: it is on the machine, it cannot be out of
date, and it is what an issue report quotes. So a flag without a `help=` is a flag nobody can
use, and it happened — `--config` shipped bare, described in the wiki and nowhere else.

Checked here rather than trusted, because adding a flag and forgetting its sentence is the
easiest omission there is.
